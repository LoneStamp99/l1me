    - `npm install`
    - `npm audit fix`
    - `npm audit`

4. Download and Extract the latest release from [HERE](https://github.com/xzendercage/l1me/releases/)

5. In the extracted folder, run these commands
    - `npm install` <- install dependencies
    - `pm2 start index.js` <-- start the script
    - `pm2 startup` <- to run L1ME on startup

6. Set a Username & Password
    1. Stop L1ME `pm2 stop index`
    2. Open `maindb.json` in a text editor
    3. under `admin` 
        - set the `username` as plain text
        - set the `password` as a LOWERCASE MD5 hash
    4. save the file
